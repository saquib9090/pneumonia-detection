# PNEUMONIA_DETECTION
This project uses deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It features a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, as well as transfer learning using DenseNet121 and ResNet50. A simple Flask web application is included for users to upload X-ray images and get real-time predictions.
Project Objective
To assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia faster and more accurately using AI and computer vision.

 Features
Upload chest X-ray images via a simple web interface

Real-time pneumonia prediction using trained deep learning models

Models: CNN (custom), DenseNet121, ResNet50

Grad-CAM visualization for explainability (optional)

User-friendly and lightweight Flask app
